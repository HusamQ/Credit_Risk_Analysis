# Credit_Risk_Analysis
To apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit crd risk
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

- Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.Then, using a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
- Compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Lastly, will evaluate the performance of these models.
